# Jacob Arellano Smartlogic Challenge

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* __Ruby__

  - The project is built using __ruby version 2.5.3p105__, you must install ruby on your local machine first. Please visit the [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) home page to get set up. Please ensure you install the version of ruby noted above.


### Installing

1. Bundle Install
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

## Using the program
  - Running the program from the command line you  give the desired filename first, then add how you would like to sort the list.
  - acceptable parameters for sorting are `lastname, firstname, gender, birthdate and color`

  - an acceptable example looks something like this
  `ruby runner.rb test_file lastname firstname`

## Reflections

  - I did not completed the challenge, but still wanted to at least turn something in. Functionality like sorting by descending is missing currently.
  - I was too focused on broader functionality that I didn't take the time to write my unit tests while I was developing my methods as a result my code is more brittle than usual. More focus on testing would have made my program more able to handle exceptions.
